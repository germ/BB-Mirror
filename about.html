								This is tricky, because if I reveal too much about myself or practice, you gain my identity. Anonymity is a key element of this body of work. I mean, if the project was done by Mr. Hockney, the prices would be sky high and the expectations much different. I <i>might</i> be David Hockney. And these pieces may be worth millions. 
								</p>

								<p>
								<b>Note: I work in images and abstract concepts. My strength of writing a coherent page is limited.</b>
								That being said, I am an established Artist who is trying to integrate a lifetime of STEM education and interest with the humanities. From a world as objective and defined to subjective with arbitrary lines in the sand, it's been a tough time. The unconscious has been devouring me lately, knowledge that can't be explained, ingrained reactions and instincts, gut feelings. But moreso the abstract and <b>arbitrary</b> frameworks we layer on top of this world. I don't know how that bike works, but I can abstract around operating it down the street and infer what my actions cause from its limited inputs.

								Recently I looked up a few graduates that I went to school with. A crew of CS, Physics, EE and Math guys, but as we were catching up over the weeks one thing consistently hit me. The walls in these apartments were bare, this project stemmed from a long night of conversations with these boys. They did not feel comfortable commissioning a work because of lack of arts knowledge, but buying a print from WalMart was too tacky for their liking. Visual art was a opaque domain, the exception to the rule was any sort of graphing of data or usage of regular geometries. Hackers need something to play with and we have a service orientated architecture sweeping the web, <b>so why not?</b>
								</p>

								<p>
								It's all phenomenological and perceived, operating in a beautiful self-correcting feedback loop. This constructed world I exist in between my ears is not matched to the objective outside. But it's close enough to carry me on, malleable enough to create my meaning and allows me a modicum of affect. It is a duct tape logic crafted on a lifetime of peanut butter coffees, late night walks, moose-leg valley shambling to sunset: A truth table made of colour, a line drawn here. Arbitrarily. As a programmer I see the world in terms of formalisms and defined interactions but as a painter I must see in terms of associative properties and think non-linearly. Trying to bootstrap one from the other is a mess, but it must be done. 
								</p>

								<p>
								The image is my preferred mode of communication, usually carried through poetry and paint. The use of the word image here does not mean a simple flat plane of pigment, but refers to the internal imagery created in the mind of the viewer. I simply lay the foundations for your mind to spin itself up, rather then construct a narrative I provide the underlying abstract descriptor or chaotic collage. <b>My own context guides my brush as I try and work with a rainy day mindset, but only yours knows of rainy day code pushes ahead of a looming milestone. </b>Maybe that is a effect of the work, or something else entirely. But whatever images your mind creates, they have power. I'm a Dioxine/Purple kind of guy, it's dark, broody, stable and it traps the eye, but that context is entirely created by my life experiences and culture. It's arbitrary, yet powerful to work with.
								</p>

								<p>
								BlackBox fell in love once. A deep connection between a neutral masked man in white cube gallery, Training his neural net via social interactions, integrating his robotic form into our micro-culture. He never said a word as we tried to learn his language, to communicate. We showed him care, empathy, play imparted how humans do to integrate into his robot mind. <br/> He left six humans serialized. <br/><br/><b>I still love you SETI, find me!</b>
