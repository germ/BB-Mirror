		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Statement: <br/><span class="text-muted">The Black Box</span></h2><br/> 
		<blockquote>
			Blackbox transforms arbitrary data into physical objects.<br/>
			That's it.<br/>
		<br/>
			Below is sincere nonsensical ramblings.<br/>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We have firmly entrenched ourselves in the age of intelligence. An age where rights and wrongs are formal and the generalizations sweeping. The marvel of the scientific method has so worked into our collective psyche  that the Post Modern critical lens became. Urges to understand, to explains is a wonderful train, but we cannot let it replace and overshadow our instinct. We need Metaxy.</p>

		<p>In Engineering the Black Box represents a complex or unknown system, the object is defined only in terms of its inputs and outputs. Never is the how or why of its operation understood, simply worked with. The Black Box is the Engineering equivalent of Magic, where <b>abstracted structures</b> are embraced if only for the sake of pushing forward to bigger problems. This project is a take on the human Black Box or the substrate to logic, the unconscious and unexplained.</p>

		<p>
			A Metamodern attempt of working with the arbitrary divide between Knowledge and Instinct.
		</p>

		<p>Willful subduing of criticality can allow us to see vivid forms melding before retina in symphony of motion and colour rather then simply “an intersection”. The first lesson in Painting is there is no object, only floating colours and forms. It is not until become cognizant of the “what” that the mind starts to interpret and burn cycles. Staring at arbitrary colours does get stale, so we <a href="http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/kandinskytext.htm">invent new structures from these primitives.</a> New language, new narrative, same context. My work plays with the nature of viewing a work, It can be analyzed or absorbed, but when both are present in one mind state?

		<p>Walk a bridge, gaze into the river 70 feet below. 
		That feeling in the heart of you, dark and clammy.
		Listen, Run!</p>

		<p>Too often we disregard that which can’t be explained a phenomena especially prevalent among Engineers and other STEM-esque paths in life. The poetics of the senses are disregarded for its thought abstractions. My work combines this need to understand, to decode, with paradox, analytic subterfuge and metaphorical relations. At best my work attempts to be read as simply a nice painting, or a object to be understood. <b>This pendulum of understanding can swing either way, dependant on the mental state of the observer.</b></p>

		<p><b>Anoninimity</b> is a key concept in this body of work. If you knew who I am, what I had done already there would be a understanding of how the Black Box works and its outputs. This understanding would destroy the investigative action on your behalf. What happens if? Can I input a song? What about an abstract feeling? Can we use Shors Algo? Every client will be considered a new body of work, any works past the first will use the context created and integrate the new inputs. <b>This is painting as a conversation, dialogue, response.</b> The use of generic clip art is intentional, to obfuscate myself. </p>

		<p>
			By assuming the identity of a web service, I try and strip myself of my history. Instead choosing to bring only what has remained with me, been ingrained into myself. Is BlackBox a personified abstraction or a formalized human? My work falls into the same area as LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner, but with a focus on infrastructure.
		</p>

		<p>We have romantic trash and ugly analytically sound Art. Each are beautiful and mind, Moloch controls what is beautiful. My work is meant as a conversation between myself and you, a highly personalized body.</p>

		<p>I’m not offering a answer, only a pendulum swinging between the arbitrarily constructed poles.
		Question everything, and in your fatigue truly see.</p>
